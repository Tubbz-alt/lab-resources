Electrolyte leakage
===================

Purpose
-------
The plasma membrane is being tested for the amount of leakage with decreasing temperatures. The loss of differential permeability to the membrane is a result of injury. Segments of different temperature stresses on the leaflets will indicate the final electrolysis leakage of the leaf. This protocol has been modified from further revised protocols, and used efficiently to measure the tolerance of induced damage on the leaves tested.

Procedure
---------

1. Cut stem at the base of petiole under water. For each genotype and temperature treatment there should be at least three tubes as replicates.
Note: It is important to have leaves at the same leaf number and stage from different plants as the tolerance is dependent on leaf order and developmental stage (Takagi et al, 2003)
2. Pat dry before putting leaflets into test tubes.
3. Put leaflets in 50 mL test tube and add 25 mL of distilled water until submerged.
4. Incubate the leaflets for thirty minutes to an hour in 4°C refrigerator before starting trial to allow temperature equilibrium in the test tubes.
5. Decrease the temperature of the water bath to -12 °C at a rate of 2 °C per half hour. The bath should begin at 4 °C. When the temperature reaches -1 °C, add tiny pieces of ice to each tube. Remove ice from tray and cut into three even pieces.
6. Begin removing the tubes from the water bath at intervals of 2 °C at -2 °C.  Make sure cap is always immediately replaced after removing from test tubes, and then place samples in 4 °C refrigerator to gradually thaw overnight.
Note: See risks below for detailed decontamination process to test tubes before removing cap.
7. Add 10 mL of distilled water to test tubes after overnight thawing and then shake solution for an hour. 
8. Measure the conductivity of the solution in each tube with the conduction probe.
Note: Make sure device is calibrated before measuring solutions in test tube.
9. Recap the centrifuge tubes and autoclave. Shake?
Measure the conductivity of the solution in each tube after autoclaving and cooling. 
10. Calculate the percentage of electrolyte leakage as the ratio of the
conductivity before autoclaving to that after autoclaving.  It is assumed that
the conductivity after autoclaving represents complete (100%) electrolyte leakage.

  - Risks : There are several chances for great error when assessing the tests, so it is vital that a cautious tone is taken throughout the trial. The test tubes after removing from ice bath are susceptible to contamination when opening; therefore, a decontamination process must take place.
  
Decontamination Process to Test Tubes
-------------------------------------

1. Remove test tube rack from ice bath and rinse under running water, until test tubes are rid of antifreeze. 
2. Take test tubes out individually and rinse upside down with caps still sealed. Then rinse tubes with distilled water using a squirt bottle.
3. Use several paper towels to remove any excess water around the edges of test tubes, so the antifreeze does not contaminate the solution inside of the test tube.
