Ordering supplies
-----------------

- You will need to get the order form from the department's website (Word document). TTU Biology --> Resources --> Administrative forms (it is the last one on the list)
- Make sure you ask the PI for the FOP account that will cover the expense,
- Fill in all the required information, including the purpose of the buy (Research/Teaching).  Then take the form to the staff member who handles purchasing.
- If ordering from a website, make sure to include the URL on the description. It will expedite your order.
- When the package arrives and Vina Khan brings it to the lab, make sure to file the purchase card in the filing cabinet.

NOTE: If you are ordering a cartridge for the printer, go directly to Vina Khan. Give her the PI's name, cartridge code, and tell her which account to use.
