Bleach Safety Protocol
======================

We use a sodium hypochlorite based bleach to clean and sterilize the hydraulic conductance equipment.

Never mix chlorine bleach with any other household or cleaning products. Doing so can result in different types of harmful acids being formed. Dangerous gases can be released and can cause severe lung damage. 

## Before handling Bleach Products ##

- Students are responsible for following safe work practices.
- Read the product label and follow instructions and recommendations listed on the label.
- Use any personal protective equipment provided by your employer such as gloves, eye goggles, and special aprons.
- Be sure you are properly trained in the need for and use of personal protective equipment.
- Use appropriate gloves to protect your hands from chemicals and sharp objects.
- After removing gloves, wash your hands with mild soap and water, and dry thoroughly.
- Avoid latex gloves if you have been diagnosed with latex allergy.
- Do not mix chlorine bleach and ammonia products together. This combination will create a toxic gas.
 
## PERSONAL HYGIENE PROCEDURES ##

If bleach contacts the skin, workers should flush the affected areas immediately with plenty of water, followed by washing with soap and water. 

Clothing contaminated with bleach should be removed immediately, and provisions should be made for the safe removal of the chemical from the clothing. Persons laundering the clothes should be informed of the hazardous properties of bleach, particularly its potential for causing irritation. 

A worker who handles bleach should thoroughly wash hands, forearms, and face with soap and water before eating, using tobacco products, using toilet facilities, applying cosmetics, or taking medication.

Workers should not eat, drink, use tobacco products, apply cosmetics, or take medication in areas where bleach or a solution containing bleach is handled, processed, or stored. 


## SPILLS AND LEAKS ##

In the event of a spill or leak involving bleach, persons not wearing protective equipment and clothing should be restricted from the area until cleanup has been completed. The following steps should be undertaken following a spill or leak:

1. Notify safety personnel.
2. Remove all sources of heat and ignition.
3. Ventilate the area of the spill or leak.
4. Keep combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from the spilled material.
5. Water spray may be used to reduce vapors, but the spray may not prevent ignition in closed spaces.
6. For small liquid spills, flood the area with large amounts of water.

## PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ##

Workers should use appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment that must be carefully selected, used, and maintained to be effective in preventing skin contact with bleach. The selection of the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, sleeves, lab coats) should be based on the extent of the worker's potential exposure to hydrogen peroxide. 
Safety showers and eye wash stations are located close to operations that involve bleach, in the hallway. 

Splash-proof chemical safety goggles should be worn during any operation in which a solvent, caustic, or other toxic substance may be splashed into the eyes.

Protective clothing should be kept free of oil and grease and should be inspected and maintained regularly to preserve its effectiveness.

Protective clothing may interfere with the body's heat dissipation, especially during hot weather or during work in hot or poorly ventilated work environments.

Specific Information regarding Chlorine

## SUBSTANCE IDENTIFICATION ##

### Formula ###

Cl(2)

### Synonyms ###

Bertholite, molecular chlorine

### Identifiers ###

1. CAS No.: 7782-50-5
2. RTECS No.: FO2100000
3. DOT UN: 1017 20
4. DOT label: Poison gas

### Appearance and odor ###

Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a characteristic pungent odor. It condenses to an amber liquid at approximately -34 degrees C (-29.2 degrees F) or at high pressures. Odor thresholds ranging from 0.08 to part per million (ppm) parts of air have been reported. Prolonged exposures may result in olfactory fatigue. 

## CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

### Physical data ###

1. Molecular weight: 70.9
2. Boiling point (at 760 mm Hg): -34.6 degrees C (-30.28 degrees F)
3. Specific gravity (liquid): 1.41 at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and a pressure of 6.86 atm
4. Vapor density: 2.5
5. Melting point: -101 degrees C (-149.8 degrees F)
6. Vapor pressure at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F): 4,800 mm Hg
7. Solubility: Slightly soluble in water; soluble in alkalies, alcohols, and chlorides.
8. Evaporation rate: Data not available.

### Reactivity ###

1. Conditions contributing to instability: Cylinders of chlorine may burst when exposed to elevated temperatures. Chlorine in solution forms a corrosive material.
2. Incompatibilities: Flammable gases and vapors form explosive mixtures with chlorine. Contact between chlorine and many combustible substances (such as gasoline and petroleum products, hydrocarbons, turpentine, alcohols, acetylene, hydrogen, ammonia, and sulfur), reducing agents, and finely divided metals may cause fires and explosions. Contact between chlorine and arsenic, bismuth, boron, calcium, activated carbon, carbon disulfide, glycerol, hydrazine, iodine, methane, oxomonosilane, potassium, propylene, and silicon should be avoided. Chlorine reacts with hydrogen sulfide and water to form hydrochloric acid, and it reacts with carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide to form phosgene and sulfuryl chloride. Chlorine is also incompatible with moisture, steam, and water.
3. Hazardous decomposition products: None reported.
4. Special precautions: Chlorine will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings.

### Flammability ###

Chlorine is a non-combustible gas. The National Fire Protection Association has assigned a flammability rating of 0 (no fire hazard) to chlorine; however, most combustible materials will burn in chlorine.

1. Flash point: Not applicable.
2. Autoignition temperature: Not applicable.
3. Flammable limits in air: Not applicable.
4. Extinguishant: For small fires use water only; do not use dry chemical or carbon dioxide. Contain and let large fires involving chlorine burn. If fire must be fought, use water spray or fog.
Fires involving chlorine should be fought upwind from the maximum distance possible. Keep unnecessary people away; isolate the hazard area and deny entry. Containers of chlorine may explode in the heat of the fire and should be moved from the fire area if it is possible to do so safely. If this is not possible, cool fire exposed containers from the sides with water until well after the fire is out. Stay away from the ends of containers. 

## HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION

### Routes of Exposure ###

Exposure to chlorine can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and eye or skin contact

### Summary of toxicology on Humans: ###

Severe acute effects of chlorine exposure in humans have been well documented since World War I when chlorine gas was used as a chemical warfare agent. Other severe exposures have resulted from the accidental rupture of chlorine tanks. These exposures have caused death, lung congestion, and pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pleurisy, and bronchitis [Hathaway et al. 1991]. The lowest lethal concentration reported is 430 ppm for 30 minutes[Clayton and Clayton 1982]. Exposure to 15 ppm causes throat irritation, exposures to 50 ppm are dangerous, and exposures to 1000 ppm can be fatal, even if exposure is brief [Sax and Lewis 1989; Clayton and Clayton 1982]. Earlier literature reported that exposure to a concentration of about 5 ppm caused respiratory complaints, corrosion of the teeth, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and susceptibility to tuberculosis among chronically-exposed workers. However, many of these effects are not confirmed in recent studies and are of very dubious significance [ACGIH 1991]. A study of workers exposed to chlorine for an average of 10.9 years was published in 1970. All but six workers had exposures below 1 ppm; 21 had TWAs above 0.52 ppm. No evidence of permanent lung damage was found, but 9.4 percent had abnormal EKGs compared to 8.2 percent in the control group. The incidence of fatigue was greater among those exposed above 0.5 ppm [ACGIH 1991]. In 1981, a study was published involving 29 subjects exposed to chlorine concentrations up to 2.0 ppm for 4- and 8-hour periods. Exposures of 1.0 ppm for 8 hours produced statistically significant changes in pulmonary function that were not observed at a 0.5 ppm exposure concentration. Six of 14 subjects exposed to 1.0 ppm for 8 hours showed increased mucous secretions from the nose and in the hypopharynx. Responses for sensations of itching or burning of the nose and eyes, and general discomfort were not severe, but were perceptible, especially at the 1.0 ppm exposure level [ACGIH 1991]. Acne (chloracne) is not unusual among persons exposed to low concentrations of chlorine for long periods of time. Tooth enamel damage may also occur [Parmeggiani 1983]. There has been one confirmed case of myasthenia gravis associated with chlorine exposure [NLM 1995].

### Signs and symptoms of exposure ###

1. Acute exposure: Acute exposure to low levels of chlorine results in eye, nose, and throat irritation, sneezing, excessive salivation, general excitement, and restlessness. Higher concentrations causes difficulty in breathing, violent coughing, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, dizziness, headache, choking, laryngeal edema, acute tracheobronchitis, chemical pneumonia. Contact with the liquid can result in frostbite burns of the skin and eyes.
2. Chronic exposure: Chronic exposure to low levels of chlorine gas can result in a dermatitis known as chloracne, tooth enamel corrosion, coughing, severe chest pain, sore throat, hemoptysis and increased susceptibility to tuberculosis.

## STORAGE ##

Chlorine should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area in tightly sealed containers that are labeled in accordance with OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard [29 CFR 1910.1200]. Containers of chlorine should be protected from exposure to weather, extreme temperatures changes, and physical damage, and they should be stored separately from flammable gases and vapors, combustible substances (such as gasoline and petroleum products, hydrocarbons, turpentine, alcohols, acetylene, hydrogen, ammonia, and sulfur), reducing agents, finely divided metals, arsenic, bismuth, boron, calcium, activated carbon, carbon disulfide, glycerol, hydrazine, iodine, methane, oxomonosilane, potassium, propylene, silicon, hydrogen sulfide and water, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, moisture, steam, and water. Workers handling and operating chlorine containers, cylinders, and tank wagons should receive special training in standard safety procedures for handling compressed corrosive gases. All pipes and containment used for chlorine service should be regularly inspected and tested. Empty containers of chlorine should have secured protective covers on their valves and should be handled appropriately.
