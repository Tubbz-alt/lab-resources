## Document Locations ##

The safety Binder is on shelf on the west lab bench. Experimental protocols are under version control. See https://github.com/schwilklab/protocols


- MSDSs - There is a master list of all MSDSs on the memory stick in Biology 516.
- SOPs – Located in the SOP tab of the Safety binder in the laboratory. 
- CHP – A hard copy without the Appendixes is located in Safety Binder in the laboratory.
- Laboratory Safety Plans – Laboratory Safety Plan binder.

## Rules and Polices ##

- All personnel are required to take Hazard Communication, Safety Awareness Training, Chemical Hygiene Plan Training, Laboratory Safety Training,  and Biological Safety Training from EH&S on an annual basis.
- All laboratory workers are to review all SOPs and SDSs for the laboratory before they are to start work in the laboratory.
- Eating, drinking, chewing gum, smoking or other use of tobacco, taking medications, and the application of cosmetics are strictly prohibited in laboratories.
- Proper lab attire must be worn at all times.  There must be no exposed skin from the waist down even when sitting. Shoes must be water repellent.
- PPE is required at all times. Lab coats must be at all times while in laboratory.  When working with liquid chemicals safety chemical goggles must be worn.  When working with any agent the proper type of glove must selected based on the hazard analysis on the SOP before work starts.
- Housekeeping is the responsibility of everyone in the laboratory and the laboratory must be picked up and all chemicals stored properly before anyone leaves.

### Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) ###

Experimental methods protocols are at https://github.com/schwilklab/protocols/methods

The lab safety plan and specific safety protocols are at https://github.com/schwilklab/protocols/safety

- All experiments have a written SOP. See https://github.com/schwilklab/protocols
- Must explain in layman terms what the experiment is about.
- Must list the potential hazards of the compounds used or generated during the experiment.
- Must list what engineering controls are to be in place.
- Must list what PPE is required.
- Must list the procedures for the experiment or process.
- Must have a waste stream analysis.
- Must be reviewed sign and dated by Dr. Schwilk (Paper copy).  See version control for all commit tracking.
- Must be signed and dated by each individual who will use the SOP (Lab binder paper copy)
- Agents that may volatize off must be worked with in the fume hood.
- Airflow must be checked for proper flow prior to fume hood being used.
- If the cabinet is not certified contact EH&S to have the hood certified.
- If the cabinet has improper flow or is not working call Physical Plant to have the hood repaired.
- Chemicals will be stored in the appropriate locations.
- All flammables will be stored in the flammables storage cabinet (under our hood) at the end of the day.
- Chemicals will be segregated based on the segregation scheme outlined in the CHP Appendix A.
- If there is a spill of a chemical use the supplied spill kit under the sink to clean up the spill.
- Use the neutralizers for any acid or base chemical spill.
- Place cleanup waste in spill kit bucket for EH&S to pick up.
- Notify EH&S that there is a spill kit bucket for pickup.
- Use a 10% bleach solution for deaconing any biological.
- Notify the Laboratory Manager so spill kit supplies can be replenished.
- If the spill is over 1 liter the lab is to be evacuated and EH&S called to assist in cleanup.
- If the spill is of a flammable chemical, regardless of amount the lab is to be evacuated and EH&S notified.
- Areas where carcinogens, mutagens or teratogens will be worked with, signs must be placed in these area to identify what hazards are present. NOTE: None of our lab protocols use carcinogens mutagens or teratogens.
- If teratogens are to be used, females need to be notified so that if alternate work arrangements need to be made.
- If an accident in the laboratory occurs where someone is injured or property is damaged an incident report is to be filled out within 24 hours and submitted to the DCHO.
- If there is an accident where medical services are needed call the University Police Department to get medical services in route.
- If a fire occurs in the laboratory that cannot be controlled by smothering the container, leave the laboratory, activate the fire alarm and call the University Police Department for help.  Then proceed to the rally point outside of the building.	
- The rally point is the north parking lot for the Biology building.
- If a near miss is observed, a near miss report is to filled out within 24 hours and submitted to the DCHO.
- During an inclement weather event, proceed to the rally point inside of the building.
- The rally point inside the building is the basement for the Biology building next to the northeastern stairwell.
- All laboratory personnel must comply with this plan and the CHP.
- Continued employment in the laboratory is contingent that the laboratory and University policies are followed.
