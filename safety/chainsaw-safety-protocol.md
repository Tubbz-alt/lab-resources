Chain Saw Safety Protocol
=========================

Operating a chain saw is inherently hazardous. Potential injuries can be minimized by using proper personal protective equipment and safe operating procedures.

## Before Starting a Chain Saw ##

- Check controls, chain tension, and all bolts and handles to ensure that they are functioning properly and that they are adjusted according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Make sure that the chain is always sharp and the lubrication reservoir is full.
- Start the saw on the ground or on another firm support. Drop starting is never allowed.
- Start the saw at least 10 feet from the fueling area, with the chain's brake engaged.

## Fueling a Chain Saw ##

- Use approved containers for transporting fuel to the saw.
- Do not use straight gasoline! Always thoroughly mix the 2-stroke oil with gasoline before filling (50:1).
- Dispense fuel at least 10 feet away from any sources of ignition when performing construction activities.Â No smoking during fueling.
- Use a funnel or a flexible hose when pouring fuel into the saw.
- Never attempt to fuel a running or HOT saw.

## Chain Saw Safety ##

- Clear away dirt, debris, small tree limbs and rocks from the saw's chain path. Look for nails, spikes or other metal in the tree before cutting.
- Shut off the saw or engage its chain brake when carrying the saw on rough or uneven terrain.
- Keep your hands on the saw's handles, and maintain secure footing while operating the saw.
- Proper personal protective equipment must be worn when operating the saw, which includes hand, foot, leg, eye, face, hearing and head protection.  Use the lab's chainsaw chaps ad head protection found on the camping gear shelf.
- Do not wear loose-fitting clothing.
- Be careful that the trunk or tree limbs will not bind against the saw.
- Watch for branches under tension, they may spring out when cut.
- Gasoline-powered chain saws must be equipped with a protective device that minimizes chain saw kickback.
- Be cautious of saw kick-back. To avoid kick-back, do not saw with the tip. If equipped, keep tip guard in place.
- Do not use the lab saw for felling trees larger than a few centimeters DBH.  Felling trees is a separate skill.
