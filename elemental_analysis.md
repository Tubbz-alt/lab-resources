Preparing samples for elemental analysis (C:N, isotopes, etc)
============================================================

Authors: Dylan Schwilk, Xiulin Gao


Overview and materials
----------------------
The process contains 3 major steps: sample collection, grinding, packing. Materials required will be listed for each step.

Sample collection and processing 
-----------------
### Materials and equipment ###

- ziplocs, envelope bags and marker
- good clippers
- large and portable coolers
- digital callipers with high accuracy
- leaf area index scanner
- drying oven
- balance

### Procedure ###

1. Collect leaf samples from plot, mark with tree tag and species code, keep all samples fresh with cooler, then transport samples back to lab
2. process all samples ASAP. each sample must be separated into two ziplocs, one is for protein analysis, another is for C/N analysis. ziplocs are marked with tree tag, species code and "P" ( for protein analysis ) or "C/N" ( for C/N analysis ). pack the same category into a large ziploc, mark this ziploc with plot, sample date, and sign your name initial on it
3. for oak species : chose 5 leaves, scan total projected (one-side) leaf area, then pack up these leaves with envelope bags, mark the bag with total leaf area, tree tag, species code and "C/N"
4. for pine species : chose 5 needles or fascicles. for single needle, measure diameter1 of needle, diameter2 of needle 90 degrees to first measurement and original length; for fascicle, cut all needles into same length , the outcome shape should look like a cylinder. then count the number of needles included in each fascicle, measure diameter1 of fascicle base, diameter2 of fascicle base 90 degrees to first measurement and length. all variables should be written down and math with sample tag and species code. after all measurements are done, pack the samples into envelope bag and mark the bag with tag, species code and "C/N"
5. put all those packed samples into drying oven, keep temperature at 72â„ƒ (?) and dry those samples for 48 hours
6. after 48 hours drying, weight all those samples and record 

Sample grinding
---------------

### Materials and equipment ###

- liquid nitrogen
- mortar and pestle
- distill water and 75% alcohol for cleaning mortar and pestle
- microcentrifuge tubes for ground material
- stander for microcentrifuges
- lab coat, goggles and gloves
- large ziplocs

### Procedure ###


1. Collect liquid nitrogen from Holaday lab 
2. clean mortar and pestle with distill water first, then use 75% alcohol to clean them one more time, then dry them with clean tissue.
3. put the sample into mortar, pour liquid nitrogen into mortar carefully, wait few seconds for liquid nitrogen " calm down ", then grind sample until it is fine enough, then pour ground sample into microcentrifuge. you can use a stander to make it convenient for you to grab a microcentrifuge
4. after a sample is done, clean mortar and pestle through step 2, then move on to next sample
5. all ground samples are packed into a large ziploc marked with date, name initial and " ground samples "

Notes: please put on your lab coat, goggles and gloves, be careful, do not burn yourself with liquid nitrogen


Sample preparation for sending out
----------------------------------

### Materials Needed and prep ###

1. 96-well plastic sample trays
2. foil tubes for samples
3. Data sheets for hard-copy data entry and recording well locations of each sample
4. 2 forceps types
5. Metal scoop/spatula 
6. Metal form for shaping foil samples 
7. microcentrifuge tube cap as a sample holder
8. Extreme sensitivity analytical balance. Only use the correct Mettler-Toledo balance (currently in Dr. Butler's lab but will be in Schwilk lab shortly)

Make sure you know how to use tis balance. Do not touch the table or the balance while taring or weighing.  Do not try to close the glass doors --- they do so automatically. This is a very sensitive and expensive piece of equipment.

Create a small sample holder by cutting the cap from a microcentrifuge tube. Turned upside-down, this holds the foil smaple tubes very nicely.

Have both sets of forceps ready. Use think forceps in right hand, thin in left (if right-handed).

### Procedure ###

1. Choose a ground sample, record the Tray ID, sample ID (eg tree tag#), and well number on the data sheet.  We will name trays this way: SCHWILK-1, SCHWILK-2, SCHWILK-3, etc.
1. Pick up a foil tube from the container with forceps (never tough with your hands!). Place this tube on the small holder in the balance and tare the balance.
2. Then place the tube open end up in one of the holes in the metal shaping form.
2. Using the metal spatula, scoop a small scoop of ground material from the storage tube (usually a microcentrifuge tube) and place this in the foil pouch/tube.  Avoid large particles, stringy material.
3. Carefully pick up the foil pouch and place it in the balance and weigh (hit "print"). This is just to check that you have the approximate correct weight. You are aiming for 0.8 to 1.8 mg of material. Adjust if necessary.
4. Return tube carefully to the metal form, and pinch the top closed with the narrow forceps.  Rotate the tube 90 degrees and pinch again. 
5. Remove tube from form and place on flat portion of form. Then lightly flatten and roll (fold 2 times) the open end down towards the closed end.
6. Shape the pouch into a small cube
7. Place pouch on balance and weigh. his is the final mass. Record this mass on the data sheet.  it should be between 0.8 and 1.8 mg.
8. Place sample in the correct well and double check that the tray id, sample id (tree tag), well number and mass are recorded.


You have prepared one sample.

Notes: Be very careful not to knock samples out of tray. Make sure tray is labeled with sharpie, make sure tray is taped closed well when not being used.
