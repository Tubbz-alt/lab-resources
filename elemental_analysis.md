Sample preparation for sending out
----------------------------------

### Materials Needed and prep ###

1. 96-well plastic sample trays
2. foil tubes for samples
3. Data sheets for hard-copy data entry and recording well locations of each sample
4. 2 forceps types
5. Metal scoop/spatula 
6. Metal form for shaping foil samples 
7. microcentrifuge tube cap as a sample holder
8. Extreme sensitivity analytical balance. Only use the correct Mettler-Toledo balance (currently in Dr. Butler's lab but will be in Schwilk lab shortly)

Make sure you know how to use tis balance. Do not touch the table or the balance while taring or weighing.  Do not try to close the glass doors --- they do so automatically. This is a very sensitive and expensive piece of equipment.

Create a small sample holder by cutting the cap from a microcentrifuge tube. Turned upside-down, this holds the foil smaple tubes very nicely.

Have both sets of forceps ready. Use think forceps in right hand, thin in left (if right-handed).

### Procedure ###

1. Choose a ground sample, record the Tray ID, sample ID (eg tree tag#), and well number on the data sheet.  We will name trays this way: SCHWILK-1, SCHWILK-2, SCHWILK-3, etc.
1. Pick up a foil tube from the container with forceps (never tough with your hands!). Place this tube on the small holder in the balance and tare the balance.
2. Then place the tube open end up in one of the holes in the metal shaping form.
2. Using the metal spatula, scoop a small scoop of ground material from the storage tube (usually a microcentrifuge tube) and place this in the foil pouch/tube.  Avoid large particles, stringy material.
3. Carefully pick up the foil pouch and place it in the balance and weigh (hit "print"). This is just to check that you have the approximate correct weight. You are aiming for 0.8 to 1.8 mg of material. Adjust if necessary.
4. Return tube carefully to the metal form, and pinch the top closed with the narrow forceps.  Rotate the tube 90 degrees and pinch again. 
5. Remove tube from form and place on flat portion of form. Then lightly flatten and roll (fold 2 times) the open end down towards the closed end.
6. Shape the pouch into a small cube
7. Place pouch on balance and weigh. his is the final mass. Record this mass on the data sheet.  it should be between 0.8 and 1.8 mg.
8. Place sample in the correct well and double check that the tray id, sample id (tree tag), well number and mass are recorded.


You have prepared one sample.

Notes: Be very careful not to knock samples out of tray. Make sure tray is labeled with sharpie, make sure tray is taped closed well when not being used.
