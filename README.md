## methods ##

Experimental methods and protocols. See individual files

## plant-id ##

Resources for plant identification. Currently, we have only a [guide to major angiosperm families](plant-id/common-angiosperm-families.md) here. We'd like to add a key to plants of Lubbock County and that will be an ongoing project aided by collections students make in BIOL-3306.

- [Schwilk Lab Guide to Major Angiosperm Families](plant-id/common-angiosperm-families.md)
- [NY Botanical Garden Glossary of Botanical Terms](http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/glossary/)
- [Glossary of botanical terms used in the OpenKey project](https://www.ibiblio.org/openkey/intkey/web/glossary.pdf)

## safety ##

Lab safety plan and safety protocols

- [schwilk-lab-safety-plan](safety/schwilk-lab-safety-plan.md): Our EHS required safety plan. Individual safety protocols covered separately
- [chainsaw-safety-protocol](safety/chainsaw-safety-protocol.md): Chainsaw safety.
- [bleach-safety-protocol](safety/bleach-safety-protocol.md): Our most dangerous lab chemical.

Instructions for editing these protocols
----------------------------------------

These files are all stored in markdown format (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ , see also https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)

If these are methods on which you are working, feel free to edit and commit changes or create an issue first to give folks a heads up on the proposed changes.

Although it is ok to commit to master, a good workflow on a shared repository is:

  1. Make a working branch for yourself.  You can even push this branch to the repository, in that case, make sure to give it a descriptive name involving the planned work or perhaps your name.
  2. Do you work in this branch and commit often.
  3. Issue a pull request so others can review your work before it is merged into /master.

  This may be overkill for the protocols repository, but may make sense for others.

Important Note:
---------------

The plan is to make this repository public. Because it is very difficult to actually delete anything from a git repository, it is important to never commit any private information we don't want shared. I don't think there is much chance of that, but I just wanted to warn everyone.
