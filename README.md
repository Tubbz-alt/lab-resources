Schwilk Lab Protocols
=====================

Repository for field and lab protocols.

Instructions for editing these protocols
----------------------------------------

These files are all stored in markdown format (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ , see also https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)

If these are methods on which you are working, feel free to edit and commit changes or create an issue first to give folks a heads up on the proposed changes.

Although it is ok to commit to master, a good workflow on a shared repository like this is:

  1. Make a working branch for yourself.  You can even push this branch to the repository, in that case, make sure to give it a descriptive name involving the planned work or perhaps your name.
  2. Do you work in this branch and commit often.
  3. Issue a pull request so others can review your work before it is merged into /master.

  This may be overkill for the protocols repository, but may make sense for others.
