# Collection #

## Equipment needed ##

- Cooler to hand carry with ice
- ziploc bags
- clippers
- aluminum ladder (optional)

## Collection and storage

Collect mature, sun leaves into ziploc bags and cover immediately with ice. Label bag with tree tag number, date, name. Return to lab within 48 hours.  Punch out 4  1-cm square holes in each leaf and put 2 punches in labeled ziploc (tag, collection date, spcode) and the other two in a labelled coin envelope. Put ziploc in freezer (-20C is ok), and put coin envelope in the drying oven.  Get dry weights and record area (should be 2 cm) and dry mass after 48 hours.

# leaf protein extraction #

## Equipment needed ##

- microcentrifuge (any microcentrifuge capable of 14,000 rpm, have an Eppendorf 5417C centrifuge in Holaday lab)
- spectrophotometer
- Small beakers (<=200 ml) for storing solutions
- Graduated cylinders for making dye solution
- pippetter(s) capable of 10 ul, 50 ul, 1 ml, and 2.5 ml
- microcentrifuge tubes (use 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes)

Reagents:

An extraction buffer with a pH of 7.5. Depending on the toughness of the leaves, this can be anything from HEPES to a Borate solution. This is what we have used in the past for oaks.

500 mM HEPES
150 mM KCl
10 mM EDTA
10 mM MgCl2
0.5 % (v/v) Triton-X
10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol
1% (w/v) PVPP

A batch solution of all these reagents, EXCEPT the mercaptoethanol and PVPP, can be stored at 4 C for years. The mercaptoethanol must be added in day of. Add the PVPP directly to sample when grinding (see step 4 of protein extraction)

## Protocol ##

- all leaves should be in the freezer and on ice when they are being extracted
-the leaf should be hole punched and an area should be taken.


### prepare the buffer solution ###

1. You will need ~1.5 mL of extraction buffer per sample being analyzed.  
2. Measure out whatever volume extraction buffer is needed that day
3. Add in 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (Do this in a hood)
3. place the buffer solution on ice

### prepare the dye solution ###

1. Need Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Regaent Concetration, 450 mL bottle (Catalog# 500-0006, order directly from bio-rad)
2. Dilute the dye in a 5:1 ratio (i.e. for 100 mL of dye, take 20 mL concentrate soln and add 80 mL RO water)
3. Diluted dye can be stored at 4 C for ~3 months.  Can make large bottle ahead of time if you have many samples to.
4. Make a new standard curve with each new bottle of protein dye.

### protein extraction ###

1. weigh the hole punched leaf sample. One 1 cm punch is fine, but do record area and fresh mass.
2. crush/grind the sample in a clean mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen.
3. add 1mL of buffer solution to the sample in the mortar.
4. add a tiny amount (tip of spatula) of PVPP to sample.
5. mix sample and liquid together and then pour in microcentrifuge tube.
6. label the sample 
7. prepare the centrifuge for the sample.
8. the centrifuge must be balanced, do not run one tube in there by itself. If have an odd number, add a black tube with H2O
8. centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 14,000 RPM
9. while the sample is being centrifuged prepare the spectrophotometer for the samples.
10. to get a standard, add 50 microliters of buffer solution in a UV cuvette and 2.5mL of biorad.
11. pull the supernatant out of the tubes from cetrifuge and pour into a test tube.
12. mark the meniscus of the test tube, the exact amount of supernatant will need to be recorded after the samples have been through the spectrophotometer.
13. to prepare the sample for the photospectrometer add 40 microliters of buffer solution, 10 microliter of supernatant, and 2.5 mL of biorad dye to UV cuvette.
14. the dye must sit for 5 minutes
15. once the sample is ready, we are measuring at a wavelength of 595
16. record all measurements.  ?? details?
17. using water and a pippette measure the amount of supernatant that was in each test tube for each sample.
18. clean up all mess and dispose of liquids correctly.
