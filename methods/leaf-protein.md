# Collection #

## Equipment needed ##

- Cooler to hand carry with ice
- ziploc bags
- clippers
- aluminum ladder (optional)

## Collection and storage

Collect mature, sun leaves into ziploc bags and cover immediately with ice. Label bag with tree tag number, date, name. Return to lab within 48 hours.  Punch out 4  1-cm square holes in each leaf and put 2 punches in labeled ziploc (tag, collection date, spcode) and the other two in a labelled coin envelope. Put ziploc in freezer (-20C is ok), and put coin envelope in the drying oven.  Get dry weights and record area (should be 2 cm) and dry mass after 48 hours.

## Equipment needed ##

- centrifuge (type?)
- spectrophotometer
- glassware ?
- pipettes ?

Reagents:


TODO

## Protocol ##

- all leaves should be in the freezer and on ice when they are being extracted
-the leaf should be hole punched and an area should be taken.


### prepare the buffer solution ###

1. in a glass beaker, add 50 mL of solution (biorad?) 
2. in the hood, add 11.7 microliters of betamercaptoethanol to the buffer solution in the glass beaker.
3. place the buffer solution on ice


### protein extraction ###

1. weigh the hole punched leaf sample. One 1 cm punch is fine, but do record area and fresh mass.
2. crush/grind the sample in a clean mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen.
3. add 1mL of buffer solution to the sample in the mortar.
4. add a tiny amount (tip of spatula) of PVPP to sample.
5. mix sample and liquid together and then pour in microcentrifuge tube.
6. label the sample 
7. prepare the centrifuge for the sample. the centrifuge must be balanced, do not run one tube in there by itself.
8. centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes. SPEED?
9. while the sample is being centrifuged prepare the spectrophotometer for the samples.
10. to get a standard, add 50 microliters of buffer solution in a UV cuvette and 2.5mL of biorad.
11. pull the supernatant out of the tubes from cetrifuge and pour into a test tube.
12. mark the meniscus of the test tube, the exact amount of supernatant will need to be recorded after the samples have been through the spectrophotometer.
13. to prepare the sample for the photospectrometer add 40 microliters of buffer solution, 10 microliter of supernatant, and 2.5 mL of biorad dye to UV cuvette.
14. the dye must sit for 5 minutes
15. once the sample is ready, we are measuring at a wavelength of 595
16. record all measurements.  ?? details?
17. using water and a pippette measure the amount of supernatant that was in each test tube for each sample.
18. clean up all mess and dispose of liquids correctly.
