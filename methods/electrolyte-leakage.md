Electrolyte leakage
===================

Purpose
-------

To measure leaf or stem resistance to freeze-induced cell membrane rupture.

We subject a series of samples to a range of low temperatures and measure leakage of cytoplasm. The loss of differential permeability to the membrane is a result of injury.

[TODO: more overview, example curve?]

Equipment and supplies
----------------------

### Computer controlled refrigerated bath ###

[TODO]

The python software to run a temperature time course is on the laptop and the laptop is connected to the Thermo refrigerated bath via USB

Procedure
---------

1. Cut stem at the base of petiole under water. For each genotype and temperature treatment there should be at least three tubes as replicates.
Note: It is important to have leaves at the same leaf number and stage from different plants as the tolerance is dependent on leaf order and developmental stage (Takagi et al, 2003)
2. Pat dry before putting leaves into test tubes.
3. Put leaves in 50 mL test tube   [Note, old instructions say: and add 25 mL of distilled water until submerged, but Mitra did these dry]
4. Incubate the leaves for thirty minutes to an hour in a 4°C refrigerator before starting trial to allow temperature equilibrium in the test tubes.
5. Decrease the temperature of the water bath to -12°C at a rate of 2°C per half hour. The bath should begin at 4°C. When the temperature reaches -1 °C, add tiny pieces of ice to each tube. Remove ice from tray and cut into three even pieces.
6. Begin removing the tubes from the water bath at intervals of 2 °C at -2 °C.  Make sure cap is always immediately replaced after removing from test tubes, and then place samples in 4 °C refrigerator to gradually thaw overnight.
Note: See risks below for detailed decontamination process to test tubes before removing cap.
7. Add 10 mL of distilled water to test tubes after overnight thawing and then shake solution for an hour. 
8. Measure the conductivity of the solution in each tube with the conduction probe.
Note: Make sure device is calibrated before measuring solutions in test tube.
9. Recap the centrifuge tubes and autoclave. Shake?
Measure the conductivity of the solution in each tube after autoclaving and cooling. 
10. Calculate the percentage of electrolyte leakage as the ratio of the
conductivity before autoclaving to that after autoclaving.  It is assumed that
the conductivity after autoclaving represents complete (100%) electrolyte leakage.

  - Risks: The test tubes after removing from ice bath are susceptible to contamination when opening; therefore, a decontamination process must take place.
  
Decontamination Process for Test Tubes
-------------------------------------

1. Remove test tube rack from ice bath and rinse under running water, until test tubes are rid of antifreeze. 
2. Take test tubes out individually and rinse upside down with caps still sealed. Then rinse tubes with distilled water using a squirt bottle.
3. Use several paper towels to remove any excess water around the edges of test tubes, so the antifreeze does not contaminate the solution inside of the test tube.
