#  BIO-RAD BRADFORD TOTAL PROTEIN ASSAY

Materials
Your extraction buffer, pH 7.5
BSA (bovine serum albumin)
Bio-Rad protein dye
Micro-pipetter and tips
Test tubes
cuvettes for spectrophotometer
spectrophotometer
 
Methods
1) Prepare standard curve, using BSA.
BSA standard curve preparation

A. Make  stock solutions of 10 ug BSA/200ul extraction buffer (10 mg/200 ml) and
freeze, until needed.
B. Dilute BSA solution with extraction solution as outlined below:
BSA standards for Bradford protein assay
Well designation ug/test tube BSA stock solution(ml)   Extraction Buffer (ml)
Blank             0                  0                       5
Standard1         0                  0                       5
Standard2       50                   1                     ` 4
Standard3       100                  2                       3
Standard4       150                 3                       2
Standard5       200                 4                       1
Standard6       250                 5                       0

2) Remove 50 ul from each tube and add to a clean cuvette
3) Start 5 min on timer. Carefully add 2.5 ml of Bio-Rad protein dye to each well.
Figure 1. Bio-Rad protein dye is added to each well.
4) After 5 min, record absorbance at 595 nm
5) Use BSA standard curve to calculate mg protein/g material extracted 
6) use linear equations to determine the slope and intercept for protien dye
7) Interpolate your results from that equation
