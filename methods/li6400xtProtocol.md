HOW TO USE THE LICOR 6400XT
(After connecting all the cables and tubes, batteries replaced, and new CO2 cylinder:)

1)	Turn the machine ON
2)	“IS THE CHAMBER/IRGA CONNECTED?” → Hit “Y”
3)	Select “LED”-This turns the light in chamber
Go to CALIBRATION MENU-Note: Zeroing the IGRA DOES NOT need to be done everytime you use the Li-Cor. Do this if you are in a new environment and have FRESH chemicals.  A bad zero is worse for than no zero at all.  If H2O stabilizes between -1 and 1 umol do NOT zero.  If CO2 is between -5 and 5 umol do NOT zero. 
4)	Select FLOW METER ZERO and hit “OK” when done zeroing
5)	Then go to IRGA ZERO. Soda lime → SCRUB, Desiccant → SCRUB
6)	Hit “Y” when asked “OK TO CONTINUE?” Make sure gaskets are closed properly.
7)	Watch CO2 and H2O drop; scrub both for at least 15 minutes. To follow progress, press “PLOT” (F4), and select R (to watch Ref CO2, and Ref H2O). Make sure that the line is horizontal. Escape button takes you back to the previous screen.
8)	After checking that CO2 and H2O values are constant (or see horizontal line), select “AUTOALL” (F3), wait till the machine re-zeros, and click on “QUIT” (F5).
9)	Go to “VIEW, STORE ZEROS AND SPANS” (NEVER SELECT “IRGA SPAN”).
10)	Click on STORE
11)	Hit “Y” to “STORE FLOW METER ZERO”.
12)	Hit “Y” to “STORE IRGA ZEROS”.
13)	Hit any key.
14)	Select “QUIT” to exit and hit ESCAPE to exit the Calibration MENU. 

15)	Go to NEW MEASUREMENTS, and select A, C, E (or in a different order) as your horizontal bars.
16)	If you don’t need to control humidity
a)	Put Dessicant tube → BYPASS and leave CO2 on SCRUB
17)	If you do need to control for humidity
a)	Put Dessicant tube between scrub and bypass, you’ll need to play with it to get proper mix once humidity is set
18)	Hit “2” to control/set  the environmental conditions (light, CO2, temperature)
19)	To set CO2 to 400 ppm: a) select “MIXER”. 
b) Scroll down to REF CO2 (R) and hit enter.
c) Change value to 400
20)	 To set light level, select LAMP  → Quantum Flux (Q) → type in level ( set to 1800 µmol m-2 s-1 )
21)	 To set leaf temperature, select TEMP → Block Temp (B) →type in level (set block temp slightly below what you want for a leaf temp, use screen K and open chamber to check ambient temp)
22)	 IF NEEDED, To set humidity, select Flow→ RH_sample  → type in level (between 45 and 60 % with 50% optimium)
23)	 Hit “1” to open a log file. Write down Date, site, time; (e.g. 4-15-05 BBNP 9am)
24)	 In “ENTER/EDIT REMARKS” write down species and plot #, initials of who measured it, (e.g. “Pa 22”). 
25)	Take your leaf; if you need more leaves to fill the chamber (e.g. grass) make sure they do not overlap! 
26)	Make sure that chamber is properly closed
27)	Check stability, CV etc. (takes about 1 minute) under “e”.
28)	 Then hit “MATCH” (located on “1”)
29)	 Hit “MATCH IRGAS” and “EXIT”
25) Before logging, make sure that 
a)	CV is still low (0.1 – 0.3), stability is 3/3 (Screen e)
b)	CO2-R is at 400 ppm (Or whatever you set it for) (Screen a)
c)	Ci is ~100-350 ppm (at night Ci >380 ppm) (Screen c)
d)	There is net PHOTO (at night PHOTO < 0) (Screen c)
e)	COND > 0.1 (Screen c)
f)	Ci/Ca ~0.55-0.8 for C3 plants (0.3 to 0.5 for C4 plants) (at night Ci/Ca >1) (Screen d)
30)	If so, press “LOG” 5 times, with 10-second intervals. 
31)	Change plants. Repeat from instruction #24.
32)	After finishing a whole set of measurements, CLOSE FILE. 

PUT LICOR IN SLEEP MODE IF YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT SET OF MEASUREMENTS OR BATTERIES NEED TO BE REPLACED. (Under UTILITY menu, scroll down to SLEEP MODE and hit “Y”). If you continue your measurements start from instruction 19).
To SWITCH OFF machine: go to WELCOME MENU and hit “QUIT OPEN/IRGAS OFF) and flip switch.
