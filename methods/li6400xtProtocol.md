Training requirements


*** if you have the funding to get there, it is HIGHLY recommended you attend a free training session at LiCor headquarters in Lincoln, NE.  If you are planning on attending one of these session, please contact Jennifer Smith to arrange getting a Li6400XT for you take with you**** 


1) Contact Jennifer Smith (jennifer.smith@ttu.edu) and/or Lizz Waring (elizabeth.waring@ttu.edu) to discuss training.

2) There is a training DVD that all new users must watch that can be checked out of the Schwilk lab.


3) prior to training know what questions you want to answer using Licor data, why you want to use the Licor to answer these questions, and your general interests in gas exchange.  This is very important for us to teach you what you need to know to answer the questions you are interested in.  IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO USE LICOR DATA, THINK ABOUT IF YOU REALLY NEED IT.  The Li6400XT is a powerful machine but it is also sensitive and requires quite a bit of finesses to use.  Expect at least 6-8 hrs of training and practice before being able to take it out on your own. 

4) attend a licor training with Jennifer Smith or Lizz Waring

5) sign the user agreement

6) practice using the licor on your own.

7) pass a user test. During this test you will have to demonstrate that you can use the licor on your own and trouble shoot it. If your trainer determines you aren't ready to take the licor out on your own, you can keep practicing in the greenhouse and try again.

Additional training videos:

These are helpful for both new and old Li6400 users.  All videos made by LiCor

Prep Checklist

1) is the machine in working order and been checked out with the appropriate person?
2) do you have CO2 cartridge? Dririte?  Soda lime? If you don't know what these are, refer back to training material?
3) if you need one, a tripod to hold the IRGA head (highly recommended to keep your arms from getting too tired and to protect the IRGA)
4) notebook to write down everything you measure and do.  Can also be used to cover screen to prevent sun damage.

If taking Li6400 to the field:
This video from LiCor is very helpful: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvrNN-a13o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvrNN-a13o "Preparing your Li400XT for field season")

1) do you have the batteries you need and chargers?  
2) Do you have back ups of all CO2 cartridges, dririte and soda lime?  
3) print out the instruction below on how to use and make sure you have the number for licor to call if you need help

If taking Li6400 to the greenhouse
1) do you have the extension cord and AC pack to use a plug in electrical source?
2) back up batteries just in case something goes wrong




HOW TO USE THE LICOR 6400XT
(After connecting all the cables and tubes, batteries replaced, and new CO2 cylinder:)

1)	Turn the machine ON
2)	“IS THE CHAMBER/IRGA CONNECTED?” → Hit “Y”
3)	Select “LED”-This turns the light in chamber
Go to CALIBRATION MENU-Note: Zeroing the IGRA DOES NOT need to be done everytime you use the Li-Cor. Do this if you are in a new environment and have FRESH chemicals.  A bad zero is worse for than no zero at all.  If H2O stabilizes between -1 and 1 umol do NOT zero.  If CO2 is between -5 and 5 umol do NOT zero. 
4)	Select FLOW METER ZERO and hit “OK” when done zeroing
5)	Then go to IRGA ZERO. Soda lime → SCRUB, Desiccant → SCRUB
6)	Hit “Y” when asked “OK TO CONTINUE?” Make sure gaskets are closed properly.
7)	Watch CO2 and H2O drop; scrub both for at least 15 minutes. To follow progress, press “PLOT” (F4), and select R (to watch Ref CO2, and Ref H2O). Make sure that the line is horizontal. Escape button takes you back to the previous screen.
8)	After checking that CO2 and H2O values are constant (or see horizontal line), select “AUTOALL” (F3), wait till the machine re-zeros, and click on “QUIT” (F5).
9)	Go to “VIEW, STORE ZEROS AND SPANS” (NEVER SELECT “IRGA SPAN”).
10)	Click on STORE
11)	Hit “Y” to “STORE FLOW METER ZERO”.
12)	Hit “Y” to “STORE IRGA ZEROS”.
13)	Hit any key.
14)	Select “QUIT” to exit and hit ESCAPE to exit the Calibration MENU. 

15)	Go to NEW MEASUREMENTS, and select A, C, E (or in a different order) as your horizontal bars.
16)	If you don’t need to control humidity
a)	Put Dessicant tube → BYPASS and leave CO2 on SCRUB
17)	If you do need to control for humidity
a)	Put Dessicant tube between scrub and bypass, you’ll need to play with it to get proper mix once humidity is set
18)	Hit “2” to control/set  the environmental conditions (light, CO2, temperature)
19)	To set CO2 to 400 ppm: a) select “MIXER”. 
b) Scroll down to REF CO2 (R) and hit enter.
c) Change value to 400
20)	 To set light level, select LAMP  → Quantum Flux (Q) → type in level ( set to 1800 µmol m-2 s-1 )
21)	 To set leaf temperature, select TEMP → Block Temp (B) →type in level (set block temp slightly below what you want for a leaf temp, use screen K and open chamber to check ambient temp)
22)	 IF NEEDED, To set humidity, select Flow→ RH_sample  → type in level (between 45 and 60 % with 50% optimium)
23)	 Hit “1” to open a log file. Write down Date, site, time; (e.g. 4-15-05 BBNP 9am)
24)	 In “ENTER/EDIT REMARKS” write down species and plot #, initials of who measured it, (e.g. “Pa 22”). 
25)	Take your leaf; if you need more leaves to fill the chamber (e.g. grass) make sure they do not overlap! 
26)	Make sure that chamber is properly closed
27)	Check stability, CV etc. (takes about 1 minute) under “e”.
28)	 Then hit “MATCH” (located on “1”)
29)	 Hit “MATCH IRGAS” and “EXIT”
25) Before logging, make sure that 
a)	CV is still low (0.1 – 0.3), stability is 3/3 (Screen e)
b)	CO2-R is at 400 ppm (Or whatever you set it for) (Screen a)
c)	Ci is ~100-350 ppm (at night Ci >380 ppm) (Screen c)
d)	There is net PHOTO (at night PHOTO < 0) (Screen c)
e)	COND > 0.1 (Screen c)
f)	Ci/Ca ~0.55-0.8 for C3 plants (0.3 to 0.5 for C4 plants) (at night Ci/Ca >1) (Screen d)
30)	If so, press “LOG” 5 times, with 10-second intervals. 
31)	Change plants. Repeat from instruction #24.
32)	After finishing a whole set of measurements, CLOSE FILE. 

PUT LICOR IN SLEEP MODE IF YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT SET OF MEASUREMENTS OR BATTERIES NEED TO BE REPLACED. (Under UTILITY menu, scroll down to SLEEP MODE and hit “Y”). If you continue your measurements start from instruction 19).
To SWITCH OFF machine: go to WELCOME MENU and hit “QUIT OPEN/IRGAS OFF) and flip switch.







LICOR STORAGE

All licors and their accessories must be keep in the Schwilk Lab when not in use.  Room 206 in the biology building.  When not in use the licor is to remain in the hard case.  

IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS OR SOMETHING BROKE YOU MUST LET SOMEONE KNOW.  We understand things happen, but if we don't know there is a problem, we can't fix it. If you repeatedly return a licor with an unreported issue, you might not be allowed to use a licor in the future. 

To store the Li6400XT:

1) loosen IRGA chamber to the gaskets aren't compressed
2) put all parts away in the hard storage case.
3) return to black shelf in 206

To store batteries
1) before returning them, make sure batteries are fully charged.  The need to be stored with a charge!!
2) place each battery on shelf.  And return chargers and cases to white shelf as well.

If you aren't sure where something goes, please ask!
