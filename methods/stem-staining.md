Stem preparation and staining protocol
======================================

:Authors: Tailor Brown, Dylan Schwilk

:Reference: Xylem staining protocol from TTU graduate student, Thiya Mukherjee.  Thiya uses this protocol to rpepare cotton xylem corss sections for anatomy work

Sample Preparation:
-------------------

1. Collect samples: Fix and preserve at 4 degrees
2. Preparation:
   - 50-70% ethyl alcohol---90ml
   - Glacial Acetic acid-------5ml
   - Commercial formalin---5ml
     (This is a general fixative for stem, root, leaves and they can be left in this mixture indefinitely)
3. Wash out fixative under running water for a couple of minutes and dehydrate the sample in alcohol series 15, 35, 70, and 95% with 1-2 hours emersion in each. 
4. Section

Staining:
-----------
### Toluidine Blue for xylem characteristics ###

Look this up.  70% solution reported for xylem anatomy work

### Safranin and fast green stain ###

1. Stain 1-12 hours in Safranin O (1% w/v in 70% ethanol)
2. Wash in DI until no more dye is removed from sections
3. Dehydrate in 30, 50, 70, 95% ethanol, 2-5 mines/step
4. Dip 5-30 seconds in fast green in 95% ethanol (0.1% w/v)
5. Wash 2 x 2 minutes each in 100% ethanol
6. Dip 5 seconds in carbol xylene or a mixture of methyl salicylate and xylene (1:1) to remove last traces of water.
7. Clear in xylene (100%) 2x
8. Mount coverslip

#### Note: ####
If safranin staining is in excess (red color seen in cellulose walls and cytoplasm) repeat steps 2-4 doubling the time for fast green and continue till step 7
If the safranin staining is pale, start from step 1 and repeat steps
If fast green staining is excess, dehydrate in 100% ethanol (step 5) and step 3 then step 4 for 10 seconds followed by step 5, 6, 7.
